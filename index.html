at the University of Idaho studying computer science. I started at the University of 
Idaho as a finance major because of my interest in business. After the first semester I 
switched to computer science as I realized my love for technology and curiosity could 
not be fulfilled fully in finance. My excitement only grew the more I learned about the 
possibilities in computer science. A particular industry that has caught my attention is 
fintech. I have read about quantative finance and found it to be quite interesting. 
Beyond fintech I have not been able to get enough of computer science. I love reading 
and learning about all things related to computer science. Recently I have read the book 
How the Internet Happened by Brian McCullogh and I thought it was so interesting how 
many technology companies came to fruition. <br> <br>
Computer science has kept me busy for quite 
some time recently, but I have many other interests. Some of which include woodworking, 
investing, reading, and spending time with my family and friends. I am very motivated 
and hope to learn as much as I can from anyone willing to offer me knowledge of any 
kind. I believe that every bit of information can help produce better ideas and improve 
my problem solving abilities.</p></font>
